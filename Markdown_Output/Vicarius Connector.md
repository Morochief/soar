Configuring Vicarius Connectors

This connector allows Stellar Cyber to ingest logs from Vicarius and add the records to the data
lake. It integrates with the Vicarius vRx API  to query assets and vulnerabilities.

Note the rate limit of 60 queries per 60 seconds listed in the Vicarius vRx documentation as
follows:

 Stellar Cyber connectors with the Collect function (collectors) may skip collecting some data
when the ingestion volume is large, which potentially can lead to data loss. This can happen
when the processing capacity of the collector is exceeded.

Adding a Vicarius Connector
To add a Vicarius connector:

1. Obtain credentials
2. Add the connector in Stellar Cyber
3. Test the connector
4. Verify ingestion

Obtaining Vicarius Credentials
Before you configure the connector in Stellar Cyber, you must obtain the following Vicarius
credentials.

Base URL—The base URL for API access. The URL has the following
format: https://<Your Dashboard Name>.vicarius.cloud/vicarius-external-data-api/

API Key—The authentication credential. Follow the guidance in the Vicarius vRx
documentation for Getting started with vRx's REST API  in the API (Integration)
section to create an API Key.

Adding the Connector in Stellar Cyber
To add a Vicarius connector in Stellar Cyber:

1. Log in to Stellar Cyber.

2. Click System | INTEGRATIONS | Connectors. The Connector Overview appears.

3. Click Create and select Connector.

The General tab of the Add Connector screen appears. The information on this tab
cannot be changed after you add the connector.

4. Choose Vulnerability Scanner from the Category dropdown.

5. Choose Vicarius from the Type dropdown.

The asterisk (*) indicates a required field.

6. For this connector, the supported Function is Collect, which is enabled already.

7. Enter a Name.



Notes:

This field does not accept multibyte characters.
It is recommended that you follow a naming convention such as
tenantname-connectortype.

8. Choose a Tenant Name. The Interflow records created by this connector include this

tenant name.

9. Choose the device on which to run the connector.

10. (Optional) When the Function is Collect, you can apply Log Filters. For information,

see Managing Log Filters.

11. Click Next. The Configuration tab appears.

The asterisk (*) indicates a required field.

12. Enter the Base URL you noted above in Obtaining Vicarius Credentials.

13. Enter the API Key you noted above.

14. (Optional) Click Disable SSL Certificate Verification if you want to disable SSL

certificate verification. Only disable SSL certificates if you have a necessary reason to,
otherwise, it is not a good security practice and may expose the connection to security
risks.

15. Choose the Interval (min). This is how often the logs are collected.

16. Choose the Content Type you would like to collect. The logs for Assets, Active

Vulnerabilities, and Vulnerabilities are supported.

  The Assets content type is always selected and cannot be removed from the

configuration as it is required for host information.

17. Click Next. The final confirmation tab appears.

18. Click Submit.

The new connector is immediately active.

Testing the Connector

 In addition to testing for connectivity, the Test button for the Vicarius connector tests that the
Base URL and API Key are correct and data requests for the requested content types return
successful responses.

When you add (or edit) a connector, we recommend that you run a test to validate the
connectivity parameters you entered. The test validates authentication and connectivity.

 For connectors running on a sensor, Stellar Cyber recommends that you allow 30-60

seconds for new or modified configuration details to be propagated to the sensor before
performing a test.

1. Click System | INTEGRATIONS | Connectors. The Connector Overview appears.

2. Locate the connector by name that you added, or modified, or that you want to test.

3. Click Test at the right side of that row. The test runs immediately.

 Note that you may run only one test at a time.

Stellar Cyber conducts a basic connectivity test for the connector and reports a success or failure
result. A successful test indicates that you entered all of the connector information correctly.

To aid troubleshooting your connector, the dialog remains open until you explicitly close it by
using the X button. If the test fails, you can select the   button from the same row to review and
correct issues.

 The connector status is updated every five (5) minutes. A successful test clears the
connector status, but if issues persist, the status reverts to failed after a minute.

Repeat the test as needed.

Verifying Ingestion
To verify ingestion:

1. Select Threat Hunting.

The Interflow Search tab appears.

2. Change the Indices for the type of content you collected:

For Assets, change the Indices to Syslog.

For Assets, change the Indices to Assets.

For Active Vulnerabilities and Vulnerabilities, change the Indices to Scans.

The table immediately updates to show ingested Interflow records.
