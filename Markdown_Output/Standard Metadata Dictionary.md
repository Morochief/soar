Standard Metadata Dictionary
Stellar Cyber monitors your network to collect and respond to data reported from multiple
sources such as network packets, endpoint telemetry, cloud logs, and threat intelligence feeds.
Each type of data is handled differently before being populated into a standardized set of fields
referred to as metadata. Where applicable, and based on your configuration and the type of
content, the data may be de-duplicated, normalized, and enriched as it passes through sensors
and the data processor, on its way to becoming part of an Interflow record.
Standard Metadata Fields in Interflow Records
The table below lists the standard metadata fields in the Stellar Cyber Interflow record, the type
of data recorded, and a description. You can use these fields as part of your searches or queries
that you build, along with vendor specific fields and values.

used as part of your GDPR compliance strategy.
